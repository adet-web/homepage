            We are project ADET, a team consisting of college students in our
            senior/junior year at NYU Tandon University. Led by cofounder Bryan,
            his fellow cofounders, CJ, Matthew, and Chris, have have come
            together to create a website for the purpose of helping any casual
            person who does not know much about how to start investing to start
            with our website. Our site provides the simple stock price
            prediction algorithms that are simple to use and view to the
            everyday person. One simple click of our algorithm will provide the
            user with the power to see future stock forecasts generated from
            special algorithmic techniques that allow for such predictions to be
            made.

            Starting in 2020, we as a team have decided to put forward our
            dream of such a website that was simple to use, and available to
            everyday people. For more advanced stock traders, they may like to
            use our hedge fund manager system to assist other people or to look
            for other managers who could ease the transition between normal and
            algorithmic trading. We also provide our own ingenious
            recommendations on the stocks that we believe will do better in the
            future with our wise judgement and experience with the assistance of
            the same algorithms provided to you! Customer satisfaction is our
            number 1 priority, and if you have any questions, please feel free
            to contact us using our contact information on the contact page
