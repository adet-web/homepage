              	We are project ADET, a team consisting of anti-social nerds who just happened to form a god tier alpha squad team in our senior/junior year at NYU Tandon University. Led by our alpha omega chad, Bryan, his lackeys and him have come together to create a website for the purpose of helping any casual person who does not know much about how to start investing to start with our website. Our site provides the simple stock price prediction algorithms that are simple to use and view to the everyday person. One simple click of our algorithm will provide the user with the power to see future stock forecasts generated from special algorithmic techniques that allow for such predictions to be made. Starting in 2020, we as a team have decided to put forward our dream of such a website that was simple to use, and available to everyday people. For more advanced stock traders, they may like to use our hedge fund manager system to assist other people or to look for other managers who could ease the transition between normal and algorithmic trading. We also provide our own ingenious recommendations on the stocks that we believe will do better in the future with our high IQ intellectual minds with the assistance of the same algorithms provided to you! The user! Customer satisfaction is our number 1 priority, next to satisfying our chad god, Strauss, in this god tier project, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at 1-800-gofuckyourself.org

              Although there is much hate and evil in this world, there always
			  seems to be a guiding light of goodness and purity in people that never
			  gets to shine. Our goal to connect more people to one another brings a solution
			  to such a hardship that has been brought upon our species. Where before we were
			  more isolated, unable to connect to one another instantly, with today's technology, 
			  such a feat is feasible. Using our gifted genius of the holy gods that rule over us,
			  we have the potential to create much more difficult and inspiring projects that will
			  solve some of the world's most difficult issues. Project ADET is just one of many 
			  projects that we have been devleoping, with many more potential projects that will 
			  inspire generations to come. Partner with us to join us on this great endeavor to develop
